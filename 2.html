     forrest killed his first pig when he was sixteen, it wasn't his choice / 
     the family starved without the meat, the town folk counted on it to it /
     this things quick, here i'll show ya / 
     uncle kaspar always helped, always showed up when no one wanted / 
     air compression shot teh bolt into the soft skkull of the swine, its last cry innocent and haunting /
