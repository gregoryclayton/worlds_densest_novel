   his wife had passed a while back now /
   nuthin was much the same since then / 
   she never moved, he never moved on /
   loading shells into the chamber with calming exhales /
   slashes in the mind, shoot on down to the village for supplies / 
   grab a malt at the old place, hadnt been there in months /
   kidsll be fine, he wouldnt dare touch that whore
