    were late on the crop this week, no money till next /
    no money /
    barden wraps some slaughtered pork in paper and shoves it at her gut /
    this is for your /

    well now hes got more, get out of here /
    she wanders off wet and stained and dissapointed / 
    and stay the fuck awy from my son
